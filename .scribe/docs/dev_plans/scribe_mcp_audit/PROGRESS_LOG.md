# Progress Log

[ℹ️] [2026-01-02 03:18:35 UTC] [Agent: Codex] [Project: scribe_mcp_audit] Rotated progress log before long-running audit work; prior entries are in PROGRESS_LOG.md.2026-01-02.md (sequence 1). Consult the rotated log for earlier investigation/test details during audits. | phase=setup; reasoning={"why":"Audit report is long-running and needs a clean log; user requested rotation and a pointer to prior context.","what":"Constraints: use rotate_log tool; append entry after rotation; include archive path for rehydration.","how":"Ran rotate_log with suffix 2026-01-02 and logged the archive path for reference."}; log_type=progress
[✅] [2026-01-02 03:18:52 UTC] [Agent: Codex] [Project: scribe_mcp_audit] Created AUDIT_REPORT.md via create_doc with sections for A–E audits and notes pointing to rotated log for prior context. No code changes will be made until audits are complete and verified. | docs=AUDIT_REPORT.md; phase=audit; reasoning={"why":"User requested immediate audit report scaffolding and strict audit-only phase (no code) until audits are complete.","what":"Constraints: use create_doc, include all audit sections, point to rotated log for prior context; no implementation work during audit.","how":"Created AUDIT_REPORT.md with sections A–E, evidence placeholders, and notes referencing PROGRESS_LOG.md.2026-01-02.md."}; log_type=progress
[ℹ️] [2026-01-02 03:27:43 UTC] [Agent: Codex] [Project: scribe_mcp_audit] Read current PROGRESS_LOG.md and noted rotation pointer to PROGRESS_LOG.md.2026-01-02.md; preparing for audit-only work per instructions (no assumptions, no code changes). | phase=audit_prep; reasoning={"why":"User instructed to read protocol/logs and get ready for a massive audit without proceeding yet.","what":"Constraints: read progress log first, audit-only with zero assumptions, no code changes; use manage_docs + AUDIT_REPORT only after approval.","how":"Fetched current progress log and recorded readiness for audit prep while awaiting user return."}; log_type=progress
[ℹ️] [2026-01-02 03:28:11 UTC] [Agent: Codex] [Project: scribe_mcp_audit] Reviewed ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md and PHASE_PLAN.md to extract current plan and Phase 0 scope; preparing to restate plan without assumptions. | phase=planning; reasoning={"why":"User asked for the plan and insisted it reflect current architectural documents only.","what":"Constraints: read architecture/phase plan, avoid assumptions, summarize only documented tasks/deliverables/acceptance criteria.","how":"Opened ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md and PHASE_PLAN.md and extracted Phase 0 goals, tasks, deliverables, and open questions for response."}; log_type=progress
[ℹ️] [2026-01-02 03:41:35 UTC] [Agent: Codex] [Project: scribe_mcp_audit] Read all current Scribe-managed docs (architecture, phase plan, checklist, audit report, proof docs, longform proof, normalize_headers live proof) plus rotated progress log to prepare Phase 0 status and audit updates without assumptions. | phase=rehydration; reasoning={"why":"User required full-file reads of all managed docs before updating plans and audit materials.","what":"Constraints: read entire files, avoid assumptions, derive status from docs/logs only.","how":"Opened architecture, phase plan, checklist, audit report, proof docs, longform proof, normalize_headers live doc, and PROGRESS_LOG.md.2026-01-02.md."}; log_type=progress
[⚠️] [2026-01-02 03:43:48 UTC] [Agent: Codex] [Project: scribe_mcp_audit] Updated ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE problem statement + requirements/constraints and attempted architecture overview update; need to re-open the file and clean up duplicated/shifted content from the overview edit before proceeding. | phase=docs; reasoning={"why":"Keep audit trail for doc edits and note the need to correct the architecture overview section.","what":"Constraints: manage_docs-only edits; avoid losing completed content; fix any structural duplication introduced by range edits.","how":"Logged completed section updates and flagged the overview edit for immediate cleanup after inspecting current file state."}; log_type=progress
[ℹ️] [2026-01-02 03:45:12 UTC] [Agent: Codex] [Project: scribe_mcp_audit] Starting investigation into section-anchored replacement conflict in doc_management manager. | component=doc_management; phase=investigation; reasoning={"how": "Read apply_doc_change, _replace_section, and related helper functions to determine extension points for deterministic header-based replacements.", "what": "Inspect doc_management.manager to find replace_range flow, header parsing helpers, and any hooks where new behavior can be inserted.", "why": "Need to understand how replace_range currently edits documents and how to prevent header duplication when editing section replacements."}; log_type=progress
[ℹ️] [2026-01-02 03:45:14 UTC] [Agent: Codex] [Project: scribe_mcp_audit] Cleaned ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE sections: rebuilt Requirements/Constraints and Architecture Overview, repaired Detailed Design + Directory Structure header, and expanded Open Questions with new audit/tooling tasks. | phase=docs; reasoning={"why":"User required audit plans to include new tasks and to preserve completed items while adding open issues and roadmap items.","what":"Constraints: manage_docs-only edits, no assumptions, keep completed items intact, fix accidental duplications from earlier range edits.","how":"Replaced the Requirements/Overview block, rewrote Detailed Design with pending roadmap items, restored Directory Structure header, and expanded Open Questions table."}; log_type=progress
