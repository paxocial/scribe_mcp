Option 2 = ~50 lines, moderate complexity, could achieve 8-12ms. Option 3 = ~200 lines, high complexity, could achieve <5ms target", "what": "OPTION 1 (Relax SLA): Change tests/test_db_activation.py lines 100,104 from <5.0 to <20.0. Accepts current performance as acceptable. OPTION 2 (Connection Pool): Modify storage/sqlite.py to maintain persistent connection instead of creating per-operation.

This explains why 5ms SLA seemed achievable initially - it was never tested until Stage 6", "what": "All SQLiteStorage methods (scribe_entries, scribe_projects, reminder_history, etc) use same base methods: _execute(), _fetchone(), _fetchall(). All call asyncio.to_thread(). All create new connections. Therefore, ALL operations suffer same overhead. Reminder operations aren't uniquely slow - they're just the first to be performance tested with aggressive SLA", "why": "Need to confirm reminder_history is not uniquely slow"}; priority=low; log_type=progress; content_type=log

Benchmark shows INSERT at ~14ms and SELECT at ~16ms - if FK was bottleneck, INSERT would be slower than SELECT. They're equivalent, proving FK is not the issue", "what": "reminder_history has FK: session_id -> scribe_sessions(session_id) ON DELETE CASCADE (line 989). IMPACT: INSERT operations must verify session_id exists in scribe_sessions (indexed lookup, ~0.1ms). DELETE from scribe_sessions triggers cascade delete in reminder_history (only during session cleanup, not during record/check operations). CHECK/SELECT operations unaffected by FK.

(2) Connection overhead (9-16ms minimum) exceeds 5ms target by definition. (3) Observed 14-19ms falls within expected range (9-16ms base + variance). (4) This is WORKING AS DESIGNED - just designed with performance trade-off.
