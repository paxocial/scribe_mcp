Key Achievements: \u2705 Repository Discovery (Git repos, Python/Node.js projects, .scribe markers), \u2705 Per-Repository Configuration (.scribe/scribe.yaml with customizable docs, permissions, plugins), \u2705 Security Sandbox (path isolation and permission enforcement), \u2705 Plugin System (repository-specific customizations), \u2705 CLI Utilities (doctor, init, use, status commands), \u2705 Multi-Repo Isolation (tested and validated), \u2705 Comprehensive Documentation (complete deployment guide). Architecture Decision: Global Deployment chosen - single Scribe installation that auto-discovers any repository with zero-config basic operation and powerful customization via .scribe/scribe.yaml. Files Created: repo_config.py, plugins/registry.py, security/sandbox.py, scripts/scribe_cli.py, GLOBAL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md, demo/ directory. Validation: All functionality tested and working.

Created comprehensive import best practices guide for both CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md, explaining MCP_SPINE as the multi-MCP infrastructure spinal cord. Moved tests to proper /tests directory with correct pathing. Documented import patterns: \u274c WRONG: from MCP_SPINE.scribe_mcp.x import y vs \u2705 CORRECT: from scribe_mcp.x import y. Issue: Internal scribe_mcp modules still import from MCP_SPINE causing ModuleNotFoundError. This requires fixing internal imports throughout scribe_mcp codebase to use relative imports instead of MCP_SPINE prefixed imports.
