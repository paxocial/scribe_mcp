<!-- ID: phase_1 -->
- [ ] Integrate Jinja2 template engine with security sandboxing (proof: Jinja2 environment setup with security constraints).

- [ ] Create bidirectional sync manager with conflict resolution (proof: sync tests with conflict scenarios).
- [ ] Add git-level change tracking with commit messages (proof: change history logs with git-style messages).
- [ ] Implement change diff visualization and history (proof: diff display in change logs).
- [ ] Create conflict resolution system with manual override (proof: conflict resolution tests).
- [ ] Add file system integrity verification (proof: integrity check tests).
- [ ] Implement database change logging and rollback (proof: database rollback tests).
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics collection (proof: performance metrics in logs).

Add sections as the phase plan grows. When tasks complete, fill in the proof column/notes so reviewers can verify the work.

## Final Verification
<!-- ID: final_verification -->
- [ ] All checklist items checked with proofs attached.
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off recorded (name + date).
