```

**Tips:**
- Always include `meta` fields tying work back to the checklist/phase (e.g., `phase=1` or `checklist_id=phase0-task2`).
- Keep confidence in a `confidence=` meta key if useful.
- Use `--dry-run` first when unsure what will be written.

---

## Reminders
- Append after every meaningful change (code, docs, decisions).
- Mention updated docs explicitly (e.g., `docs=architecture,phase_plan`).
- Rotate the log (via `rotate_log`) when it nears 200 entries.
- All rotations are cryptographically verified and auditable.

[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 01:30:03 UTC] [Agent: TestAgent] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Starting comprehensive test of doc management tools with new project 'scribe_doc_management_1' | phase=initialization; project=scribe_doc_management_1; task=doc_management_testing
[✅] [2025-10-26 01:30:09 UTC] [Agent: TestAgent] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Verified auto-generated template docs are correctly created with proper structure, anchors, and timestamps | files_checked=3; phase=verification; project=scribe_doc_management_1; task=doc_management_testing
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 01:31:04 UTC] [Agent: TestAgent] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Confirmed generate_doc_templates tool errors out when templates already exist (expected behavior). Tool may be deprecated since set_project auto-generates templates. | expected_behavior=error_on_existing; phase=tool_validation; project=scribe_doc_management_1; task=doc_management_testing; tool=generate_doc_templates
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 01:31:31 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Test message - checking scribe functionality
[✅] [2025-10-26 01:31:36 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Second test - confirming scribe tools are functional
[🐞] [2025-10-26 01:33:56 UTC] [Agent: TestAgent] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Successfully tested manage_docs tool with dry-run preview and actual edit. Issue discovered: change appears to be applied according to tool response but file content doesn't reflect the update. | anchor=problem_statement; issue=edit_not_applied; phase=tool_testing; project=scribe_doc_management_1; task=doc_management_testing; tool=manage_docs
[🐞] [2025-10-26 01:35:49 UTC] [Agent: TestAgent] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] CRITICAL BUG FOUND: manage_docs tool reports successful edits but does not actually write changes to files. The tool shows correct diff previews and returns success status, but atomic_write is not persisting changes to disk. All other tools (set_project, append_entry) work correctly. | affected_operations=["replace_section", "append", "status_update"]; issue=silent_write_failure; phase=bug_identification; project=scribe_doc_management_1; severity=critical; task=doc_management_testing; tool=manage_docs
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 01:37:22 UTC] [Agent: InvestigatorAgent] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Starting deep investigation into manage_docs modification failure. Initial file creation via set_project worked perfectly, but manage_docs modifications fail silently. This suggests the issue is specific to the modification workflow, not core file writing capability. | focus=modification_workflow; hypothesis=issue_in_replace_section_or_atomic_write_context; phase=investigation; project=scribe_doc_management_1; task=debug_manage_docs
[✅] [2025-10-26 01:37:36 UTC] [Agent: InvestigatorAgent] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Found the root cause! set_project/generate_doc_templates uses simple path.open() write (line 129), while manage_docs uses atomic_write(). The bug is specifically in the atomic_write function - it's silently failing while basic file writes work perfectly. | evidence=generate_doc_templates line 129 vs manage_docs line 83; finding=atomic_write_vs_simple_write; next_action=test_atomic_write_isolation; phase=root_cause_identified; project=scribe_doc_management_1; task=debug_manage_docs
[✅] [2025-10-26 01:39:14 UTC] [Agent: InvestigatorAgent] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] COMPREHENSIVE BUG REPORT COMPLETED: Created detailed analysis of manage_docs silent failure. Root cause identified: incorrect 'await' on synchronous atomic_write() function at manager.py:83. atomic_write function itself works perfectly - issue is purely async/await mismatch. | deliverable=comprehensive_bug_report; fix_required=remove_await; location=manager.py:83; phase=investigation_complete; project=scribe_doc_management_1; root_cause=await_on_sync_function; task=debug_manage_docs; verification=atomic_write_works_perfectly
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 01:40:00 UTC] [Agent: ArchitectAgent] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Evaluating solution approaches for atomic_write async issue. Considering creating async version vs simple fix. Leaning toward async version for consistency with codebase architecture and maintaining bulletproof reliability. | considering=["async_wrapper", "native_async", "simple_fix"]; phase=solution_analysis; preference=maintain_bulletproof_reliability; project=scribe_doc_management_1; task=design_async_atomic_write
[✅] [2025-10-26 01:40:14 UTC] [Agent: ArchitectAgent] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Solution design complete: Smartest approach is async wrapper using asyncio.to_thread() pattern. This maintains bulletproof reliability, consistency with existing async functions, and avoids code duplication. Will add async_atomic_write function that wraps the proven sync implementation. | approach=async_wrapper; benefits=["bulletproof_reliability", "code_consistency", "no_duplication", "easy_maintenance"]; pattern=asyncio.to_thread; phase=design_complete; project=scribe_doc_management_1; task=design_async_atomic_write
[🐞] [2025-10-26 01:42:36 UTC] [Agent: DebugAgent] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Testing manage_docs after implementing async_atomic_write fix. Tool response shows success with correct diff, but file content still not updated. Investigation needed - possibly import issue or different code path being used. | evidence=tool_success_but_no_file_change; issue=still_not_writing; next_step=debug_import_or_code_path; phase=fix_verification; project=scribe_doc_management_1; task=debug_manage_docs_fix

All core functionality tested and working. | message=phase=1,jinja2=implemented,template_engine=production_ready,custom_templates=enabled
[⚠️] [2025-10-26 02:18:49 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] 🔍 AUDIT REVEALED CRITICAL ISSUES: Discovered major security and functionality gaps in Jinja2 implementation. include_file can read entire disk, strict mode doesn't work, validation is brittle, missing time variables, and no legacy fallback. Pausing Phase 1 to fix these landmines before proceeding. Security-first approach required. | message=phase=1,security_audit=fail,strict_mode=broken,include_file=unsafe,validation=fragile,action=immediate_fixes_required
[🧭] [2025-10-26 02:29:27 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Initialized work session for doc management review, set active project to scribe_doc_management_1 per request and preparing to audit template system and dev_plan docs.
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 02:29:58 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Reviewed ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE, PHASE_PLAN, and CHECKLIST for scribe_doc_management_1; Phase 0/1 tasks remain unchecked despite user claim of completion and docs still include TODO boilerplate, so I’ll flag misalignment in the later summary. | docs=["ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md", "PHASE_PLAN.md", "CHECKLIST.md"]; phase=discovery
[🐞] [2025-10-26 02:32:05 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Inspected scribe_mcp/template_engine and doc_management integration; spotted fragment path bug (points to scribe_mcp/fragments instead of templates/fragments), project-level .scribe directories must live under MCP_SPINE so current repo never loads custom templates/variables, and doc_manager still imports template engine via MCP_SPINE.* which violates module guidance. Will capture these in findings. | component=template_engine; files=["scribe_mcp/template_engine/engine.py", "scribe_mcp/doc_management/manager.py"]
[🐞] [2025-10-26 02:33:32 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Confirmed additional gaps: template discovery never adds built-in documents (only .scribe/templates, templates/custom, and a mispointed fragments dir), so loader can’t ever find files like templates/documents/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE_TEMPLATE.md or fragments/directory_structure.md; render_template/render_string expose strict flag but ignore it. Need to reflect this in review. | component=template_engine; files=["scribe_mcp/template_engine/engine.py"]
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 02:35:04 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Drafting consolidated review for template engine + dev_plan: will outline doc status mismatch, discovery path bugs, strict-mode flag misuse, invalid imports, and template sample issues so team can prioritize fixes. | focus=review_summary; phase=analysis
[🧭] [2025-10-26 02:40:42 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Received new scope to clean template system: ensure all base templates live under scribe_mcp, convert built-ins to proper Jinja2, and consolidate misplaced assets so scribe_mcp remains a drop-in package. Preparing plan to audit locations/dependencies before editing. | focus=template_consolidation; phase=planning
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 02:44:41 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Audit results: base templates in scribe_mcp/templates still use legacy Mustache blocks, generate_doc_templates renders via naive string substitution, custom .scribe directory lives one level above MCP_SPINE so template engine never sees it, and template discovery skips built-in documents/fragments. Next step is to consolidate assets under scribe_mcp and convert templates + loaders to real Jinja2. | component=template_system; phase=analysis
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 04:34:38 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Initialized session for scribe_doc_management_1 to resume doc management overhaul work; preparing to review architecture/phase/checklist docs for context.
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 04:34:53 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Reviewed ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE, PHASE_PLAN, and CHECKLIST for scribe_doc_management_1 to refresh current goals around advanced Jinja2 template integration and custom template usage. | docs=architecture,phase,checklist
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 04:37:03 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Inspected existing template_engine implementation (engine.py/cli.py) and template directories to gauge completeness of current Jinja2 integration before planning enhancements for combined built-in and custom template usage. | component=template_engine
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 04:39:02 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Confirmed project goal: upgrade built-in documentation templates to advanced Jinja2 versions that support mirrored database storage and rich manage_docs editing workflows, ensuring both built-in and custom templates generate comprehensive project docs. | component=templates; phase=1
[🧭] [2025-10-26 04:40:23 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Assessment complete: template engine currently only loads .scribe/templates and templates/custom/fragments (missing templates/documents), ignores config options like templates_pack/custom dir, and built-in Markdown templates remain legacy substitution files that can’t leverage Jinja2 blocks or fragments yet. | component=template_engine; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 04:48:31 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Enhanced Jinja2 engine discovery path: it now loads project .scribe templates, repo-config custom dirs, built-in packs, and documents/fragments together (with directory typing + CLI visibility) while auto-loading repo config + uppercase legacy variables so built-in templates render under strict mode. | component=template_engine; files=template_engine/engine.py,template_engine/cli.py; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 07:45:05 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Converted all log templates (progress/doc/security/bug) to advanced Jinja2 with a shared base_log scaffold, added rotation-aware macros, and updated generate_doc_templates + rotate_log to render via the new engine with fallback so custom/built-in templates load consistently. | component=template_engine; files=templates/documents/*_LOG_TEMPLATE.md,template_engine/engine.py,tools/generate_doc_templates.py,tools/rotate_log.py; phase=1
[🧭] [2025-10-26 07:51:09 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Planning comprehensive pytest coverage: ensure template engine renders all built-in/custom templates and manage_docs can modify documents end-to-end via Jinja content/sections. | component=tests; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 07:52:00 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Added pytest coverage (`tests/test_template_engine_manage_docs.py`) to assert every built-in template renders via the Jinja engine (including .scribe overrides) and that manage_docs can replace/append sections using inline Jinja content plus custom templates with verification. | component=tests; files=tests/test_template_engine_manage_docs.py; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 07:53:10 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Resolved circular import triggered by tests: templates module now defines its own slugify helper instead of importing through scribe_mcp.tools (which auto-imported generate_doc_templates), preventing ImportError when loading doc_management in pytest. | component=templates; files=templates/__init__.py; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 07:53:54 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Eliminated remaining circular import by giving doc_management.manager its own lightweight slugify helper instead of importing through scribe_mcp.tools (which autoloaded manage_docs). This lets pytest import apply_doc_change cleanly. | component=doc_management; files=doc_management/manager.py; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 07:55:13 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Initialized file_size_before before doc operations to avoid UnboundLocalError when sandbox rejects paths early in apply_doc_change, ensuring error handling works even if file reads never occur. | component=doc_management; files=doc_management/manager.py; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 07:55:45 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Updated template/manage_docs pytest to supply structured metadata (prevent fallback) and run doc operations inside a repo-local sandbox so security checks pass; also added cleanup. | component=tests; files=tests/test_template_engine_manage_docs.py; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 07:56:13 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Expanded template-engine test metadata to include interface/notes fields so advanced architecture templates render without falling back. | component=tests; files=tests/test_template_engine_manage_docs.py; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 07:59:06 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Added directory_structure data to template engine test metadata so architecture templates can include the tree without hitting missing-key errors. | component=tests; files=tests/test_template_engine_manage_docs.py; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 07:59:43 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Provided reference list metadata in template test to satisfy new references section the architecture template renders. | component=tests; files=tests/test_template_engine_manage_docs.py; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 08:00:16 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Filled appendix metadata in template rendering test to satisfy base document footer logic. | component=tests; files=tests/test_template_engine_manage_docs.py; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 08:02:53 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Fixed checklist template loop variable shadowing (renamed section iterator to section_block) to avoid sandboxed Jinja treating section macro as a dict when metadata.sections is provided. | component=templates; files=templates/documents/CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE.md; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 08:04:39 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Adjusted checklist template to avoid calling dict.items() when metadata.sections is provided by explicitly extracting section_block["items"], preventing sandbox errors during rendering. | component=templates; files=templates/documents/CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE.md; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 08:05:28 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Expanded test metadata with sample phases/milestones so phase plan templates render completely during pytest. | component=tests; files=tests/test_template_engine_manage_docs.py; phase=1
[ℹ️] [2025-10-26 08:06:25 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Added explicit anchors to phase metadata in tests so phase plan template no longer hits missing anchor attribute. | component=tests; files=tests/test_template_engine_manage_docs.py; phase=1
[✅] [2025-10-26 08:06:43 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Template engine + manage_docs pytest now passing after providing complete metadata (phases, milestones, sections) and fixing checklist loop variable. Command: `pytest tests/test_template_engine_manage_docs.py`. | command=pytest tests/test_template_engine_manage_docs.py; component=tests; phase=1; tests_passed=2
[✅] [2025-10-26 08:14:08 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_doc_management_1] Updated generate_doc_templates to supply default metadata for all advanced Jinja templates, ensuring generated docs render fully-formed markdown; verified by rerunning pytest (tests/test_tools.py::test_generate_doc_templates_renders_files). | component=generate_doc_templates; files=tools/generate_doc_templates.py; tests=tests/test_tools.py::test_generate_doc_templates_renders_files
