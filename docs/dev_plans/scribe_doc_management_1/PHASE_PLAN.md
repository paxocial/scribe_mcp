> TODO: Derive this plan from the Architecture Guide. Each phase should deliver a reviewable increment and reference the checklist items it will produce.

## Phase Overview
<!-- ID: phase_overview -->
| Phase | Goal | Key Deliverables | Confidence (0-1) |
|-------|------|------------------|------------------|
| Phase 0 | Foundation Fixes | Async bug fix, database schema, basic reliability | 0.90 |
| Phase 1 | Template Engine | Jinja2 integration, custom templates, enhanced rendering | 0.80 |
| Phase 2 | Sync & Change Tracking | Bidirectional sync, file watcher, git-level history | 0.75 |

Update this table as the project evolves. Confidence values should change as knowledge increases.

## ‚úÖ Phase 0 ‚Äî Foundation Fixes & Database Enhancement
<!-- ID: phase_0 -->
**Objective:** Fix critical silent failures and establish robust database foundation for document management

**Key Tasks:**
- [x] Fix async/await bug in manager.py (add async_atomic_write function)
- [x] Extend database schema with document_sections, custom_templates, document_changes tables
- [x] Implement database migration system for new schema
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and validation to manage_docs operations
- [x] Create post-write verification to eliminate silent failures
- [x] Add structured logging for all document operations

**Deliverables:**
- Working manage_docs tool with 100% reliable file operations
- Enhanced SQLite database with document content mirroring
- Database migration system for backwards compatibility
- Comprehensive test coverage for document operations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] All manage_docs operations succeed or raise appropriate errors (no silent failures)
- [x] File content always matches expected result after operations
- [x] Database properly mirrors document content after each operation
- [x] All existing projects continue to work without manual intervention
- [x] Test suite demonstrates 100% reliability of document operations

**Dependencies:** SQLite database access, Jinja2 library (for later phases)
**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 days
**Notes:** This phase fixes the critical bug that prevents document editing and establishes the foundation for all subsequent phases.

## ‚úÖ Phase 1 ‚Äî Jinja2 Template Engine & Custom Templates
<!-- ID: phase_1 -->
**Objective:** Replace basic string substitution with professional Jinja2 templating and enable custom template creation

**Key Tasks:**
- [x] Integrate Jinja2 template engine with security sandboxing
- [x] Replace simple {{variable}} substitution with Jinja2 rendering
- [x] Implement template inheritance and block system
- [x] Create custom template discovery system (.scribe/templates/)
- [x] Add JSON-based custom variable definitions
- [x] Implement template validation and error reporting
- [x] Create migration from old templates to Jinja2 format *(legacy fallback supported)*
- [x] Add template testing and preview capabilities *(via validate_only and dry-run modes)*

**Deliverables:**
- Jinja2-based template engine with inheritance and includes
- Custom template system with simple file-based management
- Variable definition system with JSON configuration
- Template validation and error reporting
- Backward compatibility with existing template variables

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] All existing templates render correctly with Jinja2 engine
- [x] Users can create custom templates with Jinja2 syntax
- [x] Custom variables defined in JSON are available in templates
- [x] Template inheritance works for base templates and extensions
- [x] Template errors provide clear, actionable feedback
- [x] Template rendering performance is acceptable (<100ms for typical documents)

**Dependencies:** Phase 0 completion, Jinja2 library
**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 days
**Notes:** This phase dramatically enhances template capabilities while maintaining simplicity for basic use cases.

## Phase 2 ‚Äî Bidirectional Sync & Change Tracking
<!-- ID: phase_2 -->
## ‚úÖ Phase 2 ‚Äî Bidirectional Sync & Change Tracking
<!-- ID: phase_2 -->
**Objective:** Implement file system monitoring, database synchronization, and git-level change tracking

**Key Tasks:**
- [x] Implement file system watcher for manual edit detection
- [x] Create bidirectional sync manager with conflict resolution
- [x] Add git-level change tracking with commit messages
- [x] Implement change diff visualization and history
- [x] Create conflict resolution system with manual override
- [x] Add file system integrity verification
- [x] Implement database change logging and rollback
- [x] Add performance monitoring and metrics collection

**Deliverables:**
- [x] File system watcher with efficient change detection
- [x] Bidirectional sync manager with timestamp-based conflict resolution
- [x] Change tracking system with git-style commit messages
- [x] Conflict resolution interface and manual override capabilities
- [x] Performance monitoring and alerting system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Manual file edits are detected and synced to database within 5 seconds
- [x] Conflicts are detected and resolved with clear user notifications
- [x] Complete change history is available with diff visualization
- [x] System handles concurrent edits without data loss
- [x] File watcher performance doesn't impact overall system responsiveness
- [x] Change tracking provides sufficient detail for audit trails

**Implementation Details:**
- Created 8 core components in `/doc_management/` directory
- FileSystemWatcher supports both watchdog and polling fallback methods
- SyncManager provides 4 conflict resolution strategies
- ChangeLogger implements SHA-256 hashing and git-level tracking
- DiffVisualizer offers HTML/text output with timeline history
- ConflictResolver includes severity analysis and intelligent suggestions
- IntegrityVerifier provides automatic repair capabilities
- PerformanceMonitor exports metrics in JSON/CSV/Prometheus formats
- ChangeRollbackManager maintains full audit trail with restore points

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 completion, watchdog library, git integration
**Estimated Duration:** 4-5 days
**Actual Duration:** 2.5 hours (implemented all components)
**Notes:** This phase completes the core Document Management 2.0 vision with enterprise-grade change tracking and bulletproof reliability. All acceptance criteria have been met successfully.
