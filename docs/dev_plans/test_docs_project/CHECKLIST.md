## Documentation Hygiene
- [ ] Architecture guide updated after each code or plan change (proof: link/commit).
- [ ] Phase plan reflects current scope (proof: PROGRESS_LOG entry).
- [ ] Checklist cross-referenced in progress logs (proof: `meta checklist_id=` in entries).

---

## Phase 0 — TBD
- [ ] TBD (proof: TBD)
- [ ] TBD (proof: TBD)
- [ ] TBD (proof: TBD)

---

## Phase 1 — TBD
- [ ] TBD (proof: TBD)
- [ ] TBD (proof: TBD)
- [ ] TBD (proof: TBD)

---

## Additional Phases
- [ ] TBD (proof: TBD)

Add sections as the phase plan grows. When tasks complete, fill in the proof column/notes so reviewers can verify the work.

---

## Final Verification
- [ ] All checklist items checked with proofs attached.
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off recorded (name + date).
- [ ] Retro completed and lessons learned documented.
