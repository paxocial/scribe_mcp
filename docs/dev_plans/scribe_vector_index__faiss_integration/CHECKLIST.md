## Documentation Hygiene
<!-- ID: documentation_hygiene -->
- [ ] Architecture guide updated (proof: ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md)- [ ] Phase plan current (proof: PHASE_PLAN.md)


---## Phase 0
<!-- ID: phase_0 -->
## Phase 1 Foundation Tasks

### Configuration & Dependencies
- [ ] Add vector dependencies to requirements.txt (faiss-cpu>=1.7.0, sentence-transformers>=2.0.0, numpy>=1.20.0) (proof: requirements.txt diff)
- [ ] Extend config/settings.py with SCRIBE_VECTOR_* environment variables (proof: settings.py changes)
- [ ] Create vector configuration validation and defaults (proof: configuration tests)
- [ ] Update .gitignore to exclude .scribe_vectors/ directory (proof: .gitignore diff)

### Storage Extensions
- [ ] Create VectorIndexRecord model in storage/models.py (proof: model definitions)
- [ ] Implement deterministic entry_id generation in append_entry.py (proof: code changes + tests)
- [ ] Add entry_id to markdown log line format (proof: log output examples)
- [ ] Design and implement vector mapping database schema (proof: schema.sql + tests)

### Plugin Infrastructure
- [ ] Create VectorIndexer HookPlugin (plugins/vector_indexer.py) (proof: plugin file + manifest)
- [ ] Implement background asyncio queue and worker system (proof: implementation + tests)
- [ ] Add graceful dependency handling with fallbacks (proof: error handling tests)
- [ ] Create repository-scoped storage management (proof: isolation tests)
- [ ] Add plugin manifest and security verification (proof: manifest file + verification)

### Core Vector Operations
- [ ] Implement FAISS index creation and management (proof: index operations)
- [ ] Add embedding generation with sentence-transformers (proof: embedding tests)
- [ ] Create atomic index update procedures (proof: atomicity tests)
- [ ] Implement vector storage and retrieval operations (proof: storage tests)

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for all new components (proof: test suite results)
- [ ] Integration tests for plugin system (proof: integration test results)
- [ ] Repository isolation verification (proof: isolation test results)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for background processing (proof: benchmark results)
<!-- ID: final_verification -->
- [ ] All checklist items checked with proofs attached.  
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off recorded (name + date).  
- [ ] Retro completed and lessons learned documented.
