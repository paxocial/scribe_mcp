## Entry Format
```
[EMOJI] [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC] [Agent: <name>] [Project: Scribe Security Audit] Message text | key=value; key2=value2
```

**Tips:**
- Always include `meta` fields tying work back to the checklist/phase (e.g., `phase=1` or `checklist_id=phase0-task2`).
- Keep confidence in a `confidence=` meta key if useful.
- Use `--dry-run` first when unsure what will be written.

---

## Reminders
- Append after every meaningful change (code, docs, decisions).
- Mention updated docs explicitly (e.g., `docs=architecture,phase_plan`).
- Rotate the log (via `rotate_log`) when it nears 200 entries.
- All rotations are cryptographically verified and auditable.

[üêû] [2025-10-26 00:53:49 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: Scribe Security Audit] üîç INVESTIGATION: Found the root cause of malformed log entries! The issue is that when calling append_entry, literal \n characters in message strings were being double-escaped, causing the garbled format. Need to fix how metadata is handled in the MCP tool layer to prevent this corruption. | message=type=log_corruption,severity=critical,cause=double_escaping
[‚ùå] [2025-10-26 00:53:52 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: Scribe Security Audit] üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY FIX: Identified critical log corruption bug - metadata strings containing \n were being double-escaped.
