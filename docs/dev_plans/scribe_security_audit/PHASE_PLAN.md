# ⚙️ Phase Plan — Scribe Security Audit
**Author:** Codex (via Scribe)  
**Version:** Draft v1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25 20:50 UTC

This plan operationalizes the Architecture Guide. Work is split into two explicit phases: **Phase 1 – Audit & Alignment** and **Phase 2 – Remediation & Release**. No code modifications occur until Phase 1 deliverables are satisfied.

---

## Phase Overview
| Phase | Goal | Key Deliverables | Confidence (0-1) |
|-------|------|------------------|------------------|
| Phase 1 — Audit & Alignment | Establish authoritative understanding of Scribe MCP, document threats, align guidance docs, and produce an actionable findings report. | Updated AGENTS/CLAUDE parity notes, populated ARCH/PHASE/CHECKLIST docs, AUDIT_REPORT.md with prioritized findings, threat model + risk register. | 0.72 |
| Phase 2 — Remediation & Release | Execute fixes, strengthen tests, verify performance, and ship a stable release with documented evidence. | Patched code/config, updated tests, signed checklist, release note + verification logs. | 0.62 |

Confidence will be refined as we learn more during the audit.

## Phase 1 — Audit & Alignment
**Objective:** Produce complete documentation + audit artifacts before touching code. Confirm AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md express identical rules, enumerate all potential issues, and design remediation steps.

**Key Tasks:**
- [ ] Capture baseline inventory of Scribe MCP (tools, storage, CLI, tests) with threat surfaces.
- [ ] Review AGENTS.md vs CLAUDE.md and draft change list required for parity.
- [ ] Create `AUDIT_REPORT.md` template outlining methodology, findings, severity schema, and remediation owners.
- [ ] Perform systematic code/document review (prioritize logging, storage, reminders, CLI, security folder); record every potential issue in the audit report.
- [ ] Validate doc bootstrap + state flows manually (dry-run set_project / append_entry) without modifying code.

**Deliverables:**
- `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`, `PHASE_PLAN.md`, `CHECKLIST.md` fully populated.
- `AUDIT_REPORT.md` containing methodology, catalog of findings, and ready-for-fix action items.
- Diff specification for AGENTS.md vs CLAUDE.md alignment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Every subsystem reviewed with notes logged in PROGRESS_LOG and AUDIT_REPORT.
- [ ] No open questions about process/ownership remain in Section 9 of the Architecture Guide.
- [ ] Stakeholders sign off on the audit report and Fix phase scope.

**Dependencies:** Access to full MCP_SPINE repo, ability to run read-only commands/tests.

**Notes:** Any blocker discovered here becomes a top-level finding; no code edits permitted until acceptance criteria are met.

## Phase 2 — Remediation & Release
**Objective:** Address findings from Phase 1, harden Scribe MCP, and prove stability through automated + manual verification before publishing a release recommendation.

**Key Tasks:**
- [ ] Prioritize findings (critical/high first) and implement fixes in scoped batches.
- [ ] Add/extend automated tests covering each fix (unit, integration, regression, negative cases).
- [ ] Update AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md to the unified content baseline; confirm reviewers sign off.
- [ ] Re-run full pytest suite plus targeted performance tests; document results in CHECKLIST.md.
- [ ] Prepare release notes + rollback plan referencing relevant Scribe log entries.

**Deliverables:**
- Patched code, configs, and docs with linked PROGRESS_LOG entries.
- Updated AGENTS.md & CLAUDE.md pair containing synchronized guidance.
- Release readiness packet: test results, checklist sign-off, and deployment instructions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All audit findings marked “Resolved” or “Accepted risk” inside AUDIT_REPORT.md with evidence links.
- [ ] `pytest` (functional + optional performance) passes locally; any remaining flaky tests documented with mitigation.
- [ ] Checklist items for both phases checked with traceable evidence (log entry, commit, or artifact).

**Dependencies:** Completion of Phase 1 deliverables; availability of reviewers for security sign-off.

**Notes:** Fixes should land in small, reviewable increments; revert/rollback strategy documented for each risk area.

## Milestone Tracking
| Milestone | Target Date | Owner | Status | Evidence/Link |
|-----------|-------------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Phase 1 audit artifacts approved | 2025-10-27 | Codex | Open | Will link to AUDIT_REPORT.md + PROGRESS_LOG entry. |
| Phase 2 remediation complete & tests green | 2025-10-30 | Codex | Open | Requires pytest + checklist evidence. |

Dates will be adjusted as we gather better estimates during Phase 1.

## Retro Notes & Adjustments
- Capture phase retrospectives here once each phase concludes. Include lessons learned, scope adjustments, and follow-up work for future audits.
