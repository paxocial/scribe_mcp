## Entry Format
```
[EMOJI] [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC] [Agent: <name>] [Project: scribe_mcp_verification] Message text | key=value; key2=value2
```

**Tips:**
- Always include `meta` fields tying work back to the checklist/phase (e.g., `phase=1` or `checklist_id=phase0-task2`).
- Keep confidence in a `confidence=` meta key if useful.
- Use `--dry-run` first when unsure what will be written.

---

## Reminders
- Append after every meaningful change (code, docs, decisions).
- Mention updated docs explicitly (e.g., `docs=architecture,phase_plan`).
- Rotate the log (via `rotate_log`) when it nears 200 entries.
- All rotations are cryptographically verified and auditable.

[üß≠] [2025-10-26 03:42:51 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_mcp_verification] Kicked off Scribe MCP functionality verification: confirmed no active project and bootstrapped new scribe_mcp_verification docs to track this effort. | actions=get_project,set_project; phase=init
[üß≠] [2025-10-26 03:43:04 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_mcp_verification] Outlined a three-part verification plan covering repo review, automated tests, and manual smoke checks to validate the Scribe MCP server after the recent surgery. | phase=planning; plan_steps=3
[‚ÑπÔ∏è] [2025-10-26 03:43:18 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_mcp_verification] Reviewed repository root, git status, and README to understand the current Scribe MCP structure plus recommended smoke tests before running validations. | files=README.md; git_status=clean+new_docs; phase=analysis
[üêû] [2025-10-26 03:53:27 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_mcp_verification] Ran pytest to validate automated coverage; majority of suite passed but `tests/test_tools.py::TestEnhancedRotationEngine` cases failed because the SQLite backend lacked the `scribe_projects` table (`sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table`). | component=rotation/SQLite; failures=8; phase=testing; tests=pytest
[‚ÑπÔ∏è] [2025-10-26 04:05:09 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_mcp_verification] Fixed the MCP smoke test to run `server.py` directly with the repo-specific virtualenv and SCRIBE_ROOT/PYTHONPATH defaults, removing the stale `MCP_SPINE...` module import so the test works when scribe_mcp is the repository root. | files=scripts/test_mcp_server.py; phase=implementation
[‚ÑπÔ∏è] [2025-10-26 04:05:11 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_mcp_verification] Updated README instructions to drop the `MCP_SPINE` module path‚ÄîQuick Start, MCP config, and smoke-test steps now reference `server.py` and the current repo layout so users don‚Äôt fight import errors. | files=README.md; phase=implementation
[‚úÖ] [2025-10-26 04:05:21 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_mcp_verification] Reran `python scripts/test_mcp_server.py` and confirmed the smoke test now boots the server and lists 11 tools via stdio without MCP_SPINE path issues. | phase=testing; tests=scripts/test_mcp_server.py
[‚ÑπÔ∏è] [2025-10-26 04:16:19 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_mcp_verification] Reset active project context back to scribe_mcp_verification after temporary demo testing to keep the audit trail consistent. | phase=housekeeping
[‚ÑπÔ∏è] [2025-10-26 04:16:24 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_mcp_verification] Updated `tests/test_tools.isolated_state` to spin up a temporary SQLite backend (instead of `None`) so enhanced rotation tests have a writable schema even when Scribe runs standalone without MCP_SPINE. | files=tests/test_tools.py; phase=implementation
[‚ÑπÔ∏è] [2025-10-26 04:25:05 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_mcp_verification] Backfilled logging: ensured rotation tests provision their own SQLite backend and made the health-check test restore the original server storage/state after execution so full-suite pytest no longer inherits a closed temp database. | files=tests/test_tools.py,tests/test_health_check.py; phase=implementation
[‚úÖ] [2025-10-26 04:26:39 UTC] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: scribe_mcp_verification] Confirmed the entire pytest suite (77 tests) now passes end-to-end after fixing storage isolation and health-check cleanup‚Äîenhanced rotation scenarios succeed under the new repo layout. | phase=testing; tests=pytest
