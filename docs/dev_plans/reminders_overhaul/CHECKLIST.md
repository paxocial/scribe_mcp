## Phase 1 — Configurable Reminders + Hot Reload

### Configuration System
- [ ] **REM-001** Create reminder_config.json with comprehensive schema (proof: config file exists, schema validation passes)
- [ ] **REM-002** Implement configuration loader with validation (proof: config_loader.py, unit tests pass)
- [ ] **REM-003** Add hot-reload file watcher mechanism (proof: file_watcher.py, reload tests pass)
- [ ] **REM-004** Implement per-agent and per-project overrides (proof: override logic tests pass)
- [ ] **REM-005** Configuration precedence rules work correctly (proof: merge tests pass)

### Enhanced Reminder Engine
- [ ] **REM-006** Add rotation threshold reminder category (proof: reminder rotation tests pass)
- [ ] **REM-007** Add test health reminder category (proof: test health reminders work)
- [ ] **REM-008** Add phase drift reminder category (proof: phase drift detection works)
- [ ] **REM-009** New reminder categories are configurable (proof: category enable/disable tests pass)

### CLI Interface
- [ ] **REM-010** Implement CLI preview command (proof: reminder_cli.py preview works)
- [ ] **REM-011** Implement CLI show-config command (proof: show-config displays merged config)
- [ ] **REM-012** Implement CLI update command (proof: update makes atomic changes)
- [ ] **REM-013** CLI commands provide helpful error messages (proof: CLI error handling tests pass)

### Security & Sandbox
- [ ] **REM-014** All reminder IO uses sandbox-safe paths (proof: sandbox path tests pass)
- [ ] **REM-015** Negative tests for path traversal attacks (proof: security tests block traversal)
- [ ] **REM-016** Negative tests for symlink attacks (proof: security tests block symlinks)
- [ ] **REM-017** Configuration changes logged to security log (proof: security log entries exist)

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] **REM-018** Unit test suite passes with >90% coverage (proof: pytest coverage report)
- [ ] **REM-019** Integration tests pass end-to-end scenarios (proof: integration test suite passes)
- [ ] **REM-020** Security negative tests pass (proof: security test suite passes)
- [ ] **REM-021** CLI tests pass (proof: CLI test suite passes)
- [ ] **REM-022** Performance tests meet requirements (proof: <1s reload, >1000 evals/sec)

### Backward Compatibility
- [ ] **REM-023** Existing reminder behaviors unchanged with defaults (proof: baseline comparison tests)
- [ ] **REM-024** append_entry tool interface unchanged (proof: API compatibility tests pass)
- [ ] **REM-025** No breaking changes to existing projects (proof: existing projects work)

## Phase 2 — Advanced Features & Polish (Stretch)
- [ ] **ADV-001** Implement telemetry collection system (proof: telemetry data captured)
- [ ] **ADV-002** Create interactive CLI configuration wizard (proof: interactive CLI works)

- [ ] **ADV-004** Add plugin signing verification (proof: plugin signatures verified)
- [ ] **ADV-005** Performance optimization completed (proof: benchmark targets met)
- [ ] **ADV-006** Complete user documentation (proof: documentation published)

---

## Final Verification
- [ ] **FINAL-001** All Phase 1 checklist items checked with proofs attached (proof: all REM-001 to REM-025 complete)
- [ ] **FINAL-002** Phase 1 acceptance criteria satisfied (proof: demo steps completed successfully)
- [ ] **FINAL-003** Stakeholder sign-off recorded (name + date) (proof: sign-off entry in PROGRESS_LOG.md)
- [ ] **FINAL-004** Phase 1 retro completed and lessons learned documented (proof: retro notes in PHASE_PLAN.md)
- [ ] **FINAL-005** Architecture Guide updated with implementation details (proof: ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md reflects as-built)
