**Objective:** Establish project foundation, documentation, and technical requirements.

**Key Tasks:**
- [x] Create Reminders Overhaul project in Scribe
- [x] Generate documentation templates (ARCH, PHASE, CHECKLIST, PROGRESS)
- [x] Verify multi-log configuration exists and is functional
- [x] Author comprehensive Architecture Guide with real technical content
- [x] Define Phase Plan with concrete acceptance criteria
- [x] Create detailed Checklist with atomic implementation items
- [x] Create Audit Report with security findings and methodology

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Project documentation suite with real content
- [x] Technical requirements and architecture overview
- [x] Multi-phase implementation plan
- [x] Security audit framework with findings
- [x] Implementation checklist with traceability

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Project exists and is properly configured
- [x] All documentation templates are generated with real content
- [x] Architecture Guide covers problem, requirements, design, and implementation
- [x] Phase Plan has concrete tasks and acceptance criteria
- [x] Security audit framework is established
- [x] Checklist items are atomic and traceable to requirements

**Dependencies:** None - foundation phase

**Notes:** Foundation complete. Architecture and planning established. Ready to move to implementation.

## Phase 1 ‚Äî Configurable Reminders + Hot Reload (In Progress)
**Objective:** Externalize reminder configuration, implement hot-reload, and enable per-agent customization.

**Key Tasks:**
- [ ] Create reminder_config.json with comprehensive schema
- [ ] Implement configuration loader with validation
- [ ] Add hot-reload file watcher mechanism
- [ ] Implement per-agent and per-project configuration overrides
- [ ] Add new reminder categories (rotation, test health, phase drift)
- [ ] Implement CLI tools for preview, show-config, update
- [ ] Ensure all file operations respect sandbox boundaries
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, security)

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Externalized reminder configuration system
- [ ] Hot-reload capability with atomic config updates
- [ ] Per-agent and per-project override mechanisms
- [ ] Enhanced reminder engine with new categories
- [ ] CLI interface for configuration management
- [ ] Sandbox-safe file operations with validation
- [ ] Complete test coverage with security negative tests

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Users can edit reminder_config.json to change behavior without code changes
- [ ] Configuration changes apply immediately via hot-reload (< 1 second)
- [ ] Per-agent and per-project configurations merge correctly with precedence rules
- [ ] New reminder categories work and are configurable
- [ ] CLI commands provide intuitive configuration management
- [ ] All file I/O operations validate sandbox boundaries and reject unsafe paths
- [ ] All tests pass, including security negative tests
- [ ] Existing reminder behaviors remain unchanged with default configuration

**Dependencies:** Phase 0 complete

**Demo Steps:**
1. Show default reminder behavior
2. Edit reminder_config.json to change tone/thresholds
3. Verify changes apply immediately via hot-reload
4. Demonstrate per-agent override
5. Show CLI preview and update commands
6. Run security tests to verify sandbox enforcement

## Phase 2 ‚Äî Advanced Features & Polish (Stretch)
**Objective:** Add telemetry, advanced CLI UX, policy enforcement, and plugin signing capabilities.

**Key Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement telemetry collection for reminder effectiveness
- [ ] Add advanced CLI UX with interactive configuration
- [ ] Implement policy enforcement for configuration changes
- [ ] Add plugin signing verification for security
- [ ] Performance optimization and load testing
- [ ] Documentation and user guides completion
- [ ] Integration testing with production scenarios

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Telemetry dashboard and metrics collection
- [ ] Interactive CLI with configuration wizards
- [ ] Policy enforcement engine with approval workflows
- [ ] Plugin signing and verification system
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and optimizations
- [ ] Complete user documentation and tutorials

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Telemetry provides actionable insights about reminder effectiveness
- [ ] CLI UX enables easy configuration for non-technical users
- [ ] Policy enforcement prevents unauthorized configuration changes
- [ ] Plugin system verifies signatures and prevents tampering
- [ ] System performs well under load (1000+ reminder evaluations/sec)
- [ ] Documentation enables self-service configuration and troubleshooting

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 complete

**Demo Steps:**
1. Show telemetry dashboard with reminder effectiveness metrics
2. Demonstrate interactive CLI configuration wizard
3. Show policy enforcement in action
4. Demonstrate plugin signing verification
5. Run performance benchmarks
