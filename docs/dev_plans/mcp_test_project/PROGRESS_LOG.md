# 📜 Progress Log — MCP Test Project
**Maintained By:** Scribe
**Timezone:** UTC

> Generated automatically. Use the Scribe MCP tool (`append_entry`) or `scripts/scribe.py` to append new entries. Never edit past lines by hand.

## Entry Format
```
[EMOJI] [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC] [Agent: <name>] [Project: MCP Test Project] Message text | key=value; key2=value2
```

**Tips:**
- Always include `meta` fields tying work back to the checklist/phase (e.g., `phase=1` or `checklist_id=phase0-task2`).
- Keep confidence in a `confidence=` meta key if useful.
- Use `--dry-run` first when unsure what will be written.

---

## Initial Entries (replace once real work begins)
```
[2025-10-24 10:29:44 UTC] [ℹ️] [Agent: Scribe] [Project: MCP Test Project] Initialized progress log from template | checklist_id=bootstrap; docs_seeded=true
```

Delete the seed entry above once the first real log line lands.

---

## Reminders
- Append after every meaningful change (code, docs, decisions).
- Mention updated docs explicitly (e.g., `docs=architecture,phase_plan`).
- Rotate the log (via `rotate_log`) when it nears 200 entries.
