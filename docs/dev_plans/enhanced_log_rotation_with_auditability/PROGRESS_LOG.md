## Entry Format
```
[EMOJI] [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC] [Agent: <name>] [Project: Enhanced Log Rotation with Auditability] Message text | key=value; key2=value2
```

**Tips:**
- Always include `meta` fields tying work back to the checklist/phase (e.g., `phase=1` or `checklist_id=phase0-task2`).
- Keep confidence in a `confidence=` meta key if useful.
- Use `--dry-run` first when unsure what will be written.

## Reminders
- Append after every meaningful change (code, docs, decisions).
- Mention updated docs explicitly (e.g., `docs=architecture,phase_plan`).
- Rotate the log (via `rotate_log`) when it nears 200 entries.
