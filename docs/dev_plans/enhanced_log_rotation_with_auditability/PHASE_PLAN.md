## Phase 0 — Foundation & Infrastructure
**Objective:** Build core security utilities and enhance template system for rotation context

**Key Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `utils/integrity.py` with SHA-256 hashing functions
- [ ] Create `utils/audit.py` with metadata storage and retrieval
- [ ] Enhance `templates/__init__.py` with rotation-specific variables
- [ ] Update `PROGRESS_LOG_TEMPLATE.md` with rotation context sections
- [ ] Add rotation state management to `state/` directory
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for new utilities

**Deliverables:**
- File integrity hashing utility (`utils/integrity.py`)
- Audit trail management system (`utils/audit.py`)
- Enhanced template system with rotation variables
- Updated progress log template with rotation headers
- Rotation metadata storage schema
- Test suite covering all new components

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] SHA-256 hash generation works on files up to 10MB within 2 seconds
- [ ] Audit trail can store and retrieve rotation metadata with UUID indexing
- [ ] Template system generates rotation-aware log headers with previous log references
- [ ] Rotation metadata persists across server restarts
- [ ] All new utilities have >90% test coverage
- [ ] Error handling covers all edge cases (file not found, permission errors, corruption)

**Dependencies:**
- Existing `utils/files.py` file operations
- Template system from `generate_doc_templates.py`
- Project state management infrastructure

**Notes:** Focus on bulletproof error handling and atomic operations. All new utilities must follow the same intelligent error recovery patterns established in `append_entry.py`.

## Phase 1 — Enhanced Rotation Engine
**Objective:** Implement core rotation functionality with security, metadata collection, and template integration

**Key Tasks:**
- [ ] Enhance `rotate_log.py` with metadata collection and hashing
- [ ] Integrate template system for new log generation
- [ ] Add entry counting functionality for archived logs
- [ ] Implement UUID generation for rotation tracking
- [ ] Create sequential page numbering system
- [ ] Add rotation metadata to response format
- [ ] Implement fallback to basic file creation on template failures

**Deliverables:**
- Enhanced `rotate_log.py` with full security and auditability features
- Template-integrated new log generation system
- Rotation metadata collection and storage
- Sequential page numbering implementation
- Backward-compatible rotation API
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Rotation generates SHA-256 hash of archived file
- [ ] New logs include previous log path and hash in headers
- [ ] Entry counting accurately tracks log entries before rotation
- [ ] Sequential page numbering maintains continuity across rotations
- [ ] Rotation metadata includes UUID, timestamp, and file statistics
- [ ] Template failures gracefully fallback to basic file creation
- [ ] Performance overhead <5 seconds for 10MB log files
- [ ] Existing rotate_log API remains backward compatible

**Dependencies:**
- Phase 0 utilities (`integrity.py`, `audit.py`, enhanced templates)
- Existing `utils/files.py` rotation functions
- Project state management system

**Notes:** This is the core implementation phase. Focus on maintaining backward compatibility while adding comprehensive security and auditability features. Test thoroughly with various log sizes and corruption scenarios.

## Phase 2 — Verification & Audit Tools
**Objective:** Create comprehensive verification APIs and audit trail functionality for rotation integrity

**Key Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement `verify_rotation_integrity()` API function
- [ ] Create `get_rotation_history()` API for audit trails
- [ ] Add rotation history MCP tool
- [ ] Implement integrity verification tool
- [ ] Create rotation metadata management utilities
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite for all rotation scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing with large log files
- [ ] Documentation and usage examples

**Deliverables:**
- Integrity verification MCP tool and APIs
- Rotation history management system
- Comprehensive test coverage for rotation scenarios
- Performance benchmarks and optimization
- Complete documentation with examples
- Monitoring and alerting integration points

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Integrity verification can detect single-bit changes in archived logs
- [ ] Rotation history provides complete audit trail with timestamps
- [ ] Performance tests handle logs up to 50MB within acceptable time limits
- [ ] All rotation scenarios pass automated tests (success, failure, corruption)
- [ ] Documentation includes clear usage examples and troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Integration points for monitoring systems are functional
- [ ] Memory usage remains within acceptable limits for large files
- [ ] Error scenarios provide clear diagnostic information

**Dependencies:**
- Phase 1 enhanced rotation engine
- Phase 0 audit and integrity utilities
- Existing MCP tool infrastructure

**Notes:** Focus on making the verification tools robust and user-friendly. Consider integration with external monitoring systems and provide clear error diagnostics for troubleshooting rotation issues.
