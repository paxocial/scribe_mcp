# üèóÔ∏è Scribe MCP Architecture Guide
**Project:** Scribe MCP Server  
**Author:** CortaLabs (Codex)  
**Version:** Draft v0.3

## System Overview
Scribe exposes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that lets AI agents manage structured progress logs and supporting docs with near-zero setup. The stack is intentionally lean:

- **Server Core (`MCP_SPINE/MCP_SPINE/scribe_mcp/server.py`):** boots the stdio MCP server, wires lifecycle hooks, and shares a `StateManager`.
- **Tool Suite (`MCP_SPINE/scribe_mcp/tools/`):** atomic MCP tools for project selection, log append/rotation, recent readouts, documentation scaffolding, GitHub sync stub, and reminder-aware responses.
- **Storage Layer (`MCP_SPINE/scribe_mcp/db/`, `MCP_SPINE/scribe_mcp/utils/`):** async-friendly helpers for file IO, DB schemas, and (soon) backend-specific persistence.
- **Reminder Engine (`MCP_SPINE/scribe_mcp/reminders.py`):** centralises freshness checks and emits contextual nags that ship with every tool response.
- **Templates (`scribe_mcp/templates/` + `docs/dev_plans/1_templates`):** markdown scaffolds for architecture guides, phase plans, and logs.
- **State Cache (`scribe_mcp/state/`):** JSON-backed memo of the current project, known configs, and recent tool history for reminder context.

## Request Flow
1. **Tool Invocation:** MCP client calls a tool such as `append_entry`.
2. **State Resolution:** The tool pulls project metadata from `StateManager`, falling back to the per-project configs in `config/projects/*.json`.
3. **IO Operations:**  
   - Progress entries append to Markdown via async file helpers.  
   - When a DB backend is active, the line is mirrored into persistence and metrics are updated.
4. **Response:** Tool returns lightweight JSON with the written line/path plus reminder metadata describing overdue docs, stale logs, or project context.

---

## Reminder Engine
Every MCP tool now routes through the reminder engine before responding. The flow:

1. `state/manager.py` records the tool invocation with timestamps, session start markers, and a rolling history of the last 10 calls.
2. `reminders.get_reminders` gathers context: log frequency, document completeness, hashed doc snapshots vs. the prior audit, phase status, and stale file mtimes.
3. Weighted severity (score 1‚Äì10) is assigned per reminder. Warm-up logic downgrades alerts when a session has just resumed; thresholds are overrideable per project.
4. Tone is configurable (`defaults.reminder.tone`) so the same engine can deliver neutral, friendly, direct, or branded messaging without code changes.
5. Doc hygiene checks ensure architecture ‚Üí phase plan ‚Üí checklist remain aligned and flag semantic drift, not just timestamps.
6. Every response includes a project context line (`üéØ Project ‚Ä¶`) so auditors always know where work is happening, how many entries exist, and how long the session has been running.

Reminder generation remains non-blocking: tools still succeed but agents receive contextual nudges in the `reminders` array. The same module powers `set_project` warnings, `generate_doc_templates` follow-ups, GitHub sync messaging, and the upcoming compliance/audit surface.

## Storage Strategy (Hybrid)
- **Default:** SQLite (no external deps, tuned for local-first append workflows).  
- **Optional:** PostgreSQL (multi-user metrics, dashboards, remote installs).  
- **Adapter Layer:** `StorageBackend` abstraction drives a single tool surface while delegating to the configured engine.

Both backends now implement:
- Project upsert/listing APIs to keep DB mirrors aligned with file roots.
- Insert paths that capture SHA256 integrity, meta payloads, and timestamp variants.
- Metrics counters for success/warn/error tallies.
- Recent-fetch helpers for quick dashboards.
- **Advanced queries** that support date ranges, multi-emoji/agent filters, and meta equality checks.

The backend factory in `storage/__init__.py` inspects `settings.storage_backend`, falling back to SQLite when Postgres is unconfigured. Queries cap at 500 results and over-fetch to honour downstream message/regex filters consistently across engines.

### Advanced Query Pipeline
1. `tools/query_entries.py` normalises filters (timestamps, emoji/status, regex validation).
2. Available backend executes `StorageBackend.query_entries`, returning structured rows.
3. File-only installs fall back to parsing Markdown logs (`utils/logs.py`) and reuse shared matching helpers (`utils/search.py`).
4. Responses include raw lines to maintain compatibility with legacy tooling while surfacing structured fields for MCP clients.

### Rate & Safety Guards
- Regex validation happens at the tool layer; invalid patterns short-circuit with descriptive errors.
- Backend queries enforce absolute limits and filter meta keys using a conservative allowlist (`[A-Za-z0-9_.:-]`).
- File fallback centralises parsing logic to avoid drift from append formatting rules.

## Configuration Guardrails
The `set_project` tool now validates inputs before mutating disk or state:
- Rejects re-use of progress log or docs directories already claimed by another project (state or config-backed).
- Warns on overlapping repository roots to surface potential boundary conflicts.
- Verifies write permissions for root/docs/log parents before scaffolding.
- Surfaces warnings in the response payload so agents can notify operators or prompt remediation.

Validation runs prior to doc bootstrap and DB upserts, preventing partially-initialised projects from polluting state.

---

## Documentation Contract
- Update this guide whenever system architecture, tool surface, or directory structure changes.
- Ensure the phase plan and checklist remain aligned with the sections above; discrepancies should trigger a planning retro.
- Progress log entries must reference affected components (e.g., `meta: component=storage_backend`) so future audits map work back to design intent.

---

## Error Handling & Observability
- Tools never raise raw exceptions to the client; they return structured `{"ok": False, "error": ...}` payloads.
- File operations use thread executors to avoid blocking the event loop.
- Future upgrades will add structured logging around DB failures, plus optional GitHub sync events.

---

## Open Questions
1. Storage backend resiliency (connection pooling, retry policies) for Postgres under load.  
2. SQLite schema migrations/versioning strategy when fields evolve.  
3. Long-running MCP usage: per-agent rate limiting (roadmapped) and batching strategies.  
4. GitHub integration toggles (auth, network gating).  
5. Optional summarisation/LLM enrichment once baseline workflow is rock solid.

---

## Next Steps
- Harden storage tests across both backends (including advanced query coverage).  
- Expand docs generation tool to support overwrite prompts or versioning.  
- Add structured config documentation for MCP clients (env vars, state paths).  
- Harden tests (Austin-run) for concurrent append, validation guardrails, and backend parity.  
- Draft GitHub sync design doc once network allowances are green-lit.
