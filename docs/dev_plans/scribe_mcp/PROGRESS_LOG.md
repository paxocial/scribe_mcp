[🧭] [2025-12-07 10:15:50 UTC] [Agent: Codex] [Project: scribe_mcp] Received directive to update AGENTS.md only; pausing other work and focusing on adding project-creation workflow note (set_project + manage_docs) per user request | priority=high; reasoning={"how": "Will edit AGENTS.md to add instruction to run set_project then manage_docs to create architecture/supporting docs and note logging allowance", "what": "Must only edit AGENTS.md; follow commandment 0 (progress log read), avoid other files; log steps", "why": "User requested AGENTS.md reflect new rule for project creation workflow"}; scope=docs; task=agents_md_update; log_type=progress
