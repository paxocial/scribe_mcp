### MCP Server Core (`MCP_SPINE/scribe_mcp/server.py`)
- Boots a stdio-based MCP server using the official `mcp` Python SDK when available (falls back to a permissive stub if the SDK is missing for local testing).
- Registers all tools under a single `Server` instance. During import it dynamically adds `@app.tool` support if the SDK version lacks the helper decorators (maintaining compatibility with older SDKs).
- Manages server lifecycle hooks (`setup`, `close`), delegating to the active storage backend.
- Exposes global singletons:
  - `state_manager`: orchestrates persistent state.
  - `storage_backend`: chosen at startup (SQLite by default, Postgres when configured).

### Configuration Layer (`config/settings.py`)
- Parses environment variables with fallbacks for repository discovery (`SCRIBE_ROOT`, `SCRIBE_STATE_PATH`).
- Determines storage backend selection (`SCRIBE_STORAGE_BACKEND`, `SCRIBE_DB_URL`).
- Sets operational limits (log rotation size, rate limiting, reminder defaults).
- Exposes reminder tuning knobs (tone, severity weights, idle reset thresholds) via `Settings.reminder_defaults`.

### State Manager (`state/manager.py`)
- Reliable JSON-backed state file supporting:
  - Current project selection and metadata cache (`config/projects/*.json`).
  - Rolling history of the last 10 tool invocations, each with timestamp—feeds reminder cadence.
  - Session tracking (`session_started_at`, `last_activity_at`) to detect restarts and idle thresholds.
  - Atomic updates (`record_tool`, `set_current_project`, `update_project_metadata`) guarded by an `asyncio.Lock` for safe concurrent access.
- Normalizes tool history entries to ensure backwards compatibility as state evolves.

### Storage Backends (`storage/`)
- **SQLite backend** (`sqlite.py`): 
  - On-demand connections with busy timeout.
  - Mirrored schema (projects, entries, metrics) for local-first deployments.
  - JSON meta storage and timestamp indexes for fast queries.
- **Postgres backend** (`postgres.py`): 
  - Asyncpg pool management.
  - Utilizes SQL helpers in `db/ops.py` for upsert, insert, and query operations.
- Both backends implement the `StorageBackend` interface defined in `storage/base.py` to keep tool logic backend-agnostic.

### Reminder Engine (`reminders.py`)
- Central governance unit producing structured reminders for every tool response.
- Features:
  - **Severity scoring**: default weight mapping (info/warning/urgent) promoted to dynamic scoring (1–10). Sessions in “warmup” mode downgrade warnings to informational until the team settles back in.
  - **Tone customization**: `defaults.reminder.tone` allows neutral, friendly, direct, or custom voices without code changes.
  - **Doc drift detection**: stores SHA-1 hashes per doc; diffs highlight changed artifacts and outdated content (e.g., architecture guide, phase plan).
  - **Staleness checks**: timezone-aware comparisons guard against missing UTC offsets.
  - **Workflow enforcement**: warns when development proceeds before architecture/phase/checklist are in acceptable states.
  - **Context reminder**: ensures every reply identifies the active project, log counts, and session age.

---

## Operational Workflow

1. **Bootstrap**:
   - `set_project` is invoked (via MCP or CLI script) to register the project, generate missing docs, and prime state/storage.
   - Templates produce `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`, `PHASE_PLAN.md`, `CHECKLIST.md`, `PROGRESS_LOG.md`; reminders prompt follow-up if placeholders remain.

2. **Daily Logging**:
   - After meaningful work, agents call `append_entry` with message, status, metadata, and optional timestamp overrides.
   - Log line is appended to disk, mirrored to DB, and reminders return any action items (e.g., “phase plan incomplete”, “no log in 20 minutes”).

3. **Analysis & Governance**:
   - `read_recent` supplies tail views for quick checks.
   - `query_entries` offers full search, powering dashboards or compliance scripts.
   - Reminders (included in every response) build a feedback loop for doc hygiene, coverage, and cadence.

4. **Rotation & Audits**:
   - `rotate_log` archives large logs into timestamped copies, reinitializes fresh log files.
   - Future `audit_project` (roadmap) will convert reminder signals into a compliance score for dashboards.

---

## Configuration & Deployment

### Environment Variables
- `SCRIBE_ROOT`: Absolute path to `MCP_SPINE` directory (critical for Codex integration).
- `SCRIBE_STORAGE_BACKEND`: `sqlite` (default) or `postgres`.
- `SCRIBE_DB_URL`: Postgres connection string when needed.
- `SCRIBE_LOG_*`: Rate limits and file rotation settings.
- `SCRIBE_REMINDER_*`: Idle and warmup thresholds, JSON defaults (severity weights, tone, etc.).

### MCP Integration
- `MCP_SPINE/config/mcp_config.json` demonstrates stdio configuration with environment overrides.
- Codex CLI registration example:
  ```bash
  codex mcp add scribe \
    --env SCRIBE_ROOT=/home/austin/projects/Scribe/MCP_SPINE \
    --env SCRIBE_STORAGE_BACKEND=sqlite \
    -- python -m MCP_SPINE.scribe_mcp.server
  ```
- `MCP_SPINE/scripts/test_mcp_server.py` performs a `tools/list` handshake to validate server readiness before wiring into Codex.

### CLI Utility (`scripts/scribe.py`)
- Standalone script for local append operations. Reads `config/projects/*.json`, falls back to environment defaults, supports dry-run mode, and respects `SCRIBE_ROOT`.

---

## Reminder Governance Model

### Inputs
- Tool history (name + timestamp) from `StateManager`.
- Document status map (missing/incomplete/complete) with per-doc hashes.
- Sessions tracked via `session_started_at` and `last_activity_at`.
- Configurable thresholds and tone per project or global defaults.

### Outputs
- Structured reminders: `{"level", "score", "emoji", "message", "context", "category", "tone"}`.
- Logging prompts (info/warning/urgent) based on minutes since last entry, with session warmup smoothing.
- Doc hygiene alerts for missing or template-filled docs.
- Drift notifications when doc hashes change since last scan.
- Staleness warnings based on mtime + configurable days.
- Workflow escalations if coding proceeds without architectural sign-off.

### Extensibility
- Additional categories (e.g., “metrics”, “pipeline”) can be layered by returning new Reminder objects.
- `defaults.reminder` in project configs provides deep customization without touching code.
