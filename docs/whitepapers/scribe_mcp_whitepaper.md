```

### Environment Configuration & External Repos
- **SCRIBE_ROOT**: Absolute path to the project root where `docs/dev_plans/<project>/...` lives. Set this when running Scribe against any repo outside `MCP_SPINE`.
- **SCRIBE_STATE_PATH**: Writable JSON state file (per-user or per-repo). Defaults to `~/.scribe/state.json`; override for isolated test runs.
- **Optional storage envs**: `SCRIBE_STORAGE_BACKEND` (`sqlite` | `postgres`) and `SCRIBE_DB_URL` for Postgres deployments.
- **PYTHONPATH**: Include the parent of `scribe_mcp` when launching from other repos so imports resolve.
- **.env loading**: Scribe now best-effort auto-loads `.env` via `python-dotenv` on startup; shell/process manager exports still work as usual.
- **Overlap detection**: Root overlaps are tolerated when progress logs/docs differ (e.g., many dev_plan folders under one repo). Actual collisions on `progress_log` or `docs_dir` remain guarded.

### MCP Server Core (`MCP_SPINE/scribe_mcp/server.py`)
- Boots a stdio-based MCP server using the official `mcp` Python SDK when available (falls back to a permissive stub if the SDK is missing for local testing).
- Registers all tools under a single `Server` instance. During import it dynamically adds `@app.tool` support if the SDK version lacks the helper decorators (maintaining compatibility with older SDKs).
- Manages server lifecycle hooks (`setup`, `close`), delegating to the active storage backend.
- Exposes global singletons:
  - `state_manager`: orchestrates persistent state.
  - `storage_backend`: chosen at startup (SQLite by default, Postgres when configured).

### Configuration Layer (`config/settings.py`)
- Parses environment variables with fallbacks for repository discovery (`SCRIBE_ROOT`, `SCRIBE_STATE_PATH`).
- Determines storage backend selection (`SCRIBE_STORAGE_BACKEND`, `SCRIBE_DB_URL`).
- Sets operational limits (log rotation size, rate limiting, reminder defaults).
- Exposes reminder tuning knobs (tone, severity weights, idle reset thresholds) via `Settings.reminder_defaults`.

### State Manager (`state/manager.py`)
- Reliable JSON-backed state file supporting:
  - Current project selection and metadata cache (`config/projects/*.json`).
  - Rolling history of the last 10 tool invocations, each with timestamp—feeds reminder cadence.
  - Session tracking (`session_started_at`, `last_activity_at`) to detect restarts and idle thresholds.
  - Atomic updates (`record_tool`, `set_current_project`, `update_project_metadata`) guarded by an `asyncio.Lock` for safe concurrent access.
- Normalizes tool history entries to ensure backwards compatibility as state evolves.

### Storage Backends (`storage/`)
- **SQLite backend** (`sqlite.py`): 
  - On-demand connections with busy timeout.
  - Mirrored schema (projects, entries, metrics) for local-first deployments.
  - JSON meta storage and timestamp indexes for fast queries.
- **Postgres backend** (`postgres.py`): 
  - Asyncpg pool management.
  - Utilizes SQL helpers in `db/ops.py` for upsert, insert, and query operations.
- Both backends implement the `StorageBackend` interface defined in `storage/base.py` to keep tool logic backend-agnostic.

### Reminder Engine (`reminders.py`)
- Central governance unit producing structured reminders for every tool response.
- Features:
  - **Severity scoring**: default weight mapping (info/warning/urgent) promoted to dynamic scoring (1–10). Sessions in “warmup” mode downgrade warnings to informational until the team settles back in.
  - **Tone customization**: `defaults.reminder.tone` allows neutral, friendly, direct, or custom voices without code changes.
  - **Doc drift detection**: stores SHA-1 hashes per doc; diffs highlight changed artifacts and outdated content (e.g., architecture guide, phase plan).
  - **Staleness checks**: timezone-aware comparisons guard against missing UTC offsets.
  - **Workflow enforcement**: warns when development proceeds before architecture/phase/checklist are in acceptable states.
  - **Context reminder**: ensures every reply identifies the active project, log counts, and session age.

### Project Registry & Lifecycle (`shared/project_registry.py`, `tools/list_projects.py`)

Scribe includes a **SQLite-backed Project Registry** that turns projects into first-class, queryable entities:

- **Registry Table (`scribe_projects`, SQLite-first)**:
  - Fields (conceptual): `id`, `name`, `description`, `status`, `created_at`, `last_entry_at`, `last_access_at`, `last_status_change`, `tags`, `meta`.
  - Lifecycle states: `planning | in_progress | blocked | complete | archived | abandoned`.
  - Backed by the existing `SQLiteStorage` and automatically extended via `_ensure_schema` (no destructive migrations).
- **Integration Hooks**:
  - `set_project`:
    - Ensures a `scribe_projects` row exists for each logical project.
    - Populates dev_plan rows for core docs (`architecture`, `phase_plan`, `checklist`, `progress_log`).
    - Updates `last_access_at` on each selection.
  - `append_entry`:
    - For `log_type="progress"`, calls `ProjectRegistry.touch_entry`, which updates `last_entry_at` and can auto‑promote `status` from `planning` → `in_progress` once core docs exist and at least one progress entry has been written.
  - `manage_docs`:
    - Calls `ProjectRegistry.record_doc_update` after successful doc writes, recording:
      - `meta.docs.last_update_at`, `last_doc_type`, `last_action`, `update_count`.
      - `baseline_hashes[doc]` and `current_hashes[doc]` per doc type.
      - Derived flags like `architecture_touched`, `phase_plan_modified`, `docs_started`, `docs_ready_for_work`.
- **Runtime Meta Enrichment (`get_project` / `list_projects`)**:
  - `meta.activity` (computed at read time, not stored):
    - `project_age_days`
    - `days_since_last_entry`
    - `days_since_last_access`
    - `staleness_level` (`fresh|warming|stale|frozen`)
    - `activity_score` — scalar score combining recency, entry rate, doc readiness, and optional `meta.project.priority`.
  - `meta.project`:
    - Container for project-level metadata (e.g., `owner`, `priority`, `domain`, `work_blockers`).

### Dev Plan Doc Flow (End-to-End Sequence)

Scribe’s dev-plan pipeline follows a fixed, auditable sequence that ties MCP tools, templates, and the registry together:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as MCP Client / Agent
    participant Scribe as Scribe MCP Server
    participant Registry as Project Registry (SQLite)
    participant FS as Dev Plan Docs (ARCH/PHASE/CHECKLIST/LOG)

    Client->>Scribe: set_project(project_name)
    Scribe->>Registry: ensure_project + touch_access
    Scribe->>FS: generate_doc_templates (ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE, PHASE_PLAN, CHECKLIST, PROGRESS_LOG)
    FS-->>Registry: baseline hashes recorded via record_doc_update

    Client->>Scribe: manage_docs.append / replace_section / status_update
    Scribe->>FS: Atomic write with diff + verification
    Scribe->>Registry: record_doc_update(doc, action, before_hash, after_hash)
    Scribe->>FS: append_entry(log_type="doc_updates")

    Client->>Scribe: append_entry(log_type="progress")
    Scribe->>FS: Append progress line
    Scribe->>Registry: touch_entry(project_name, log_type="progress")

    Client->>Scribe: list_projects / get_project
    Scribe->>Registry: enrich with meta.activity + meta.docs + meta.project
    Registry-->>Client: status, timestamps, activity_score, doc hygiene flags
```

This flow is the canonical reference for how `set_project`, `generate_doc_templates`, `manage_docs`, and `append_entry` interact with the Project Registry and dev_plan documents. For template-level context details, see `docs/TEMPLATE_VARIABLES.md`.

    - Drift metrics: `doc_drift_days_since_update`, `drift_score` (scalar representing how out-of-date docs are versus the log).

**Enhanced `list_projects` Tool Surface**

- Arguments:
  - `limit: Optional[int] = 5`
  - `filter: Optional[str] = None` (name substring)
  - `compact: bool = False`
  - `fields: Optional[List[str]] = None`
  - `include_test: bool = False`
  - `page: int = 1`
  - `page_size: Optional[int] = None`
  - `status: Optional[List[str]] = None` (lifecycle filter)
  - `tags: Optional[List[str]] = None` (contains-any tag filter)
  - `order_by: Optional[str] = None` (`created_at|last_entry_at|last_access_at|total_entries`)
  - `direction: str = "desc"` (`asc|desc`)
- Behavior:
  - Merges storage-backed projects and state-managed projects.
  - Enriches each with Project Registry data, including `meta.activity` and `meta.docs`.
  - Applies name, status, and tag filters.
  - Normalizes timestamps to UTC-aware datetimes when ordering to avoid naive/aware comparison errors.
  - Supports both compact and full-field responses via `fields` + `COMPACT_FIELD_MAP`.

**Doc Hygiene & Drift Governance**

The registry’s doc-aware meta enables concrete doc-hygiene enforcement:

- Core concepts:
  - **Template vs. Real Docs**:
    - `baseline_hashes[doc]` captures the first non-empty hash of a template before a real edit.
    - `current_hashes[doc]` tracks the latest applied content.
    - `*_touched` and `*_modified` flags are derived automatically.
  - **Readiness**:
    - `docs_started` — at least one core doc has been touched.
    - `docs_ready_for_work` — architecture, phase plan, and checklist have all been touched.
  - **Drift**:
    - `doc_drift_suspected` — raised when:
      - Status is `in_progress` or `complete`, and
      - Docs are not ready, or
      - `last_entry_at` substantially post-dates `last_update_at`.
    - `doc_drift_days_since_update` — numeric delta in days.
    - `drift_score` — scalar used to rank how badly a project’s docs lag its logs.

These signals are exposed via `list_projects(fields=["name","status","meta"])` so orchestrators and future agents can decide:
- Which projects to prioritize.
- Which projects require doc hygiene sweeps before additional work.

### Enterprise Utilities (`utils/`)
**Production-Grade Infrastructure Components**
- `files.py`: Bulletproof atomic operations with Write-Ahead Logging, cross-platform locking, and integrity verification
- `integrity.py`: SHA-256 hashing, file verification, and corruption detection systems
- `audit.py`: Comprehensive audit trail management with metadata storage and retrieval
- `rotation_state.py`: Log rotation state tracking with hash chains and sequence numbering
- `search.py`: Advanced text search with exact/substring/regex matching and filtering
- `time.py`: Timezone-aware time utilities with UTC formatting and range handling
- `logs.py`: Enhanced log line parsing with structured data extraction and validation

### Security & Reliability (`security/`)
**Sandboxed Operations and Access Control**
- `sandbox.py`: Path validation and access control for secure file operations
- Repository sandbox enforcement preventing unauthorized file access
- Template rendering security with restricted Jinja2 environments
- Input validation and sanitization across all tool interfaces

---

## Operational Workflow

1. **Bootstrap**:
   - `set_project` is invoked (via MCP or CLI script) to register the project, generate missing docs, and prime state/storage.
   - Templates produce `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`, `PHASE_PLAN.md`, `CHECKLIST.md`, `PROGRESS_LOG.md`; reminders prompt follow-up if placeholders remain.

2. **Daily Logging**:
   - After meaningful work, agents call `append_entry` with message, status, metadata, and optional timestamp overrides.
   - Log line is appended to disk, mirrored to DB, and reminders return any action items (e.g., “phase plan incomplete”, “no log in 20 minutes”).

3. **Analysis & Governance**:
   - `read_recent` supplies tail views for quick checks.
   - `query_entries` offers full search, powering dashboards or compliance scripts.
   - Reminders (included in every response) build a feedback loop for doc hygiene, coverage, and cadence.

4. **Rotation & Audits**:
   - `rotate_log` archives large logs into timestamped copies, reinitializes fresh log files.
   - Future `audit_project` (roadmap) will convert reminder signals into a compliance score for dashboards.

## Configuration & Deployment

### Environment Variables
- `SCRIBE_ROOT`: Absolute path to `MCP_SPINE` directory (critical for Codex integration).
- `SCRIBE_STORAGE_BACKEND`: `sqlite` (default) or `postgres`.
- `SCRIBE_DB_URL`: Postgres connection string when needed.
- `SCRIBE_LOG_*`: Rate limits and file rotation settings.
- `SCRIBE_REMINDER_*`: Idle and warmup thresholds, JSON defaults (severity weights, tone, etc.).

### MCP Integration
- `MCP_SPINE/config/mcp_config.json` demonstrates stdio configuration with environment overrides.
- Codex CLI registration example:
  ```bash
  codex mcp add scribe \
    --env SCRIBE_ROOT=/home/austin/projects/Scribe/MCP_SPINE \
    --env SCRIBE_STORAGE_BACKEND=sqlite \
    -- python -m MCP_SPINE.scribe_mcp.server
  ```
- `MCP_SPINE/scripts/test_mcp_server.py` performs a `tools/list` handshake to validate server readiness before wiring into Codex.

### CLI Utility (`scripts/scribe.py`)
- Standalone script for local append operations. Reads `config/projects/*.json`, falls back to environment defaults, supports dry-run mode, and respects `SCRIBE_ROOT`.

---

## Reminder Governance Model

### Inputs
- Tool history (name + timestamp) from `StateManager`.
- Document status map (missing/incomplete/complete) with per-doc hashes.
- Sessions tracked via `session_started_at` and `last_activity_at`.
- Configurable thresholds and tone per project or global defaults.

### Outputs
- Structured reminders: `{"level", "score", "emoji", "message", "context", "category", "tone"}`.
- Logging prompts (info/warning/urgent) based on minutes since last entry, with session warmup smoothing.
- Doc hygiene alerts for missing or template-filled docs.
- Drift notifications when doc hashes change since last scan.
- Staleness warnings based on mtime + configurable days.
- Workflow escalations if coding proceeds without architectural sign-off.

### Extensibility
- Additional categories (e.g., “metrics”, “pipeline”) can be layered by returning new Reminder objects.
- `defaults.reminder` in project configs provides deep customization without touching code.
